Hostel Bank 🏦

Managing shared expenses in a hostel can be difficult when different people pay for travel, food, and other costs. Keeping track and splitting expenses manually is tiring. Hostel Bank makes this process easy by helping users manage and settle expenses in groups.

Users can create groups like "Picnic" or "Hotel" and request money from each other. If one person requests ₹100 from another and later gets a request for ₹50 from the same person, the system automatically adjusts the amount to ₹50.
